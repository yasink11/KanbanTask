# KanbanTask
Kanban task application that I created using React.js



# This project IS about:

* An application created for task tracking.
* Tasks can be added with cards under the Backlog, To Do, In Progress and Done columns.
* Lean task model: you can see title, description, date tag headers.
* Tasks are stored on your browser cache.
